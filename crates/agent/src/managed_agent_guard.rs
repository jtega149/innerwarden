//! Spec 081 — Managed-Agent Coexistence verifier.
//!
//! InnerWarden is both a host EDR **and** an AI-agent guardrail. When a legit,
//! IW-managed AI agent (e.g. OpenClaw running as
//! `node .../node_modules/openclaw/dist/index.js`, comm `MainThread`) runs on
//! the same host, its NORMAL startup behaviour — reading its own `.env`, opening
//! a persistent socket to its own Slack / Azure endpoint — matches the generic
//! `sensitive_read → outbound_connect` exfil/C2 signature. IW then takes
//! HOST-perimeter responses (block the destination IP, kernel-deny the agent's
//! next execve) that are wrong, harmful, and weak.
//!
//! This module is the **response-side** gate consulted by BOTH harmful response
//! paths (the userspace destination-IP block and the kernel PID-block). It does
//! NOT touch DETECTION: the incident still fires, the operator is still
//! notified; only the automatic block/kernel-deny RESPONSE is withheld.
//!
//! Hard constraints (operator, security-engineer-no-gaps — see
//! `.specify/features/081-managed-agent-coexistence/spec.md`):
//!
//! 1. **Never relax DETECTION of specific credential paths.** `.env/.aws/.ssh/
//!    shadow/...` stay fully detected + the incident still fires. We only change
//!    the automatic BLOCK/KERNEL-DENY RESPONSE.
//! 2. **Never exempt by destination** (cloud/Slack/AWS/Azure). The relaxation
//!    axis is the SOURCE process, never the destination — attackers use cloud
//!    for C2, and the agent keeps working when its destination IP rotates.
//! 3. **Positive, multi-signal, live-verified identity.** A single forgeable
//!    signal (comm `MainThread`, a registry pid hit alone, an exe-path string)
//!    is NOT enough. Require an AND of independent signals, re-verified LIVE at
//!    decision time, **fail-closed** (cannot verify → block).
//! 4. **Downgrade, never silence.** Even when relaxed, the incident is recorded
//!    and the operator is notified. The only thing removed is the automatic
//!    IP-block / kernel-deny.
//!
//! The verifier is split into a pure [`decide`] core (which operates on already-
//! resolved facts) and a thin `/proc` resolver ([`ProcResolver`] /
//! [`SystemProc`]). This keeps the no-hole property fully unit-testable without
//! a real `/proc` — the 7 anti-evasion tests inject [`ResolvedProcess`] facts.
