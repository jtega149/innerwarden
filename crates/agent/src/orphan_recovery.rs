//! Phase 7B (audit RC-2 / 2026-04-29): orphan-incident recovery sweep.
//!
//! Why this module exists:
//!
//! The agent's standard incident processing path (`process/incidents.rs`)
//! reads incidents via a SQLite cursor (`agent_cursors` table), runs them
//! through the AI router, and writes a decision row. When the agent
//! restarts (deploy, crash, manual restart), the cursor advances past
//! incidents that were in-flight at the moment of restart but never got
//! their decision committed. Those incidents stay in the `incidents`
//! table forever without a corresponding `decisions` row — orphans.
//!
//! Pre-Phase-7 these orphans were invisible to the operator: the dashboard
//! read from the lossy in-memory KG which TTL-evicted them after ~12h.
//! Phase 7 surfaced them as the "Stuck >1h" pending-breakdown bucket —
//! useful health signal, but the bucket grows unboundedly because nothing
//! ever clears the orphans. The dashboard ended up showing "AI pipeline
//! may be wedged" with 37 stuck incidents while the AI was healthily
//! processing the steady stream.
//!
//! The recovery pass closes the loop:
//! 1. Every 10 minutes, query SQLite for incidents whose `ts` is >1h ago
//!    and have no `decisions` row joined.
//! 2. For each, write a decision with `ai_provider="orphan-recovery"` and a
//!    clear reason. **Severity-gated (Spec 062 invariant):** Low/Medium/Info
//!    orphans are `dismiss`ed (safe noise cleanup); **High/Critical orphans
//!    are RETRIED through the decider once (spec 071 Part C) — a pure-verdict
//!    close resolves them, otherwise they are routed to `needs_review`, never
//!    silently dismissed** — they stay visible/audited and the needs_review
//!    timeout sweep leaves High/Critical in needs_review forever. The hash chain
//!    stays intact (the standard `decisions::append_chained` is used) and the
//!    audit trail is honest.
//! 3. The Stuck bucket on the next dashboard tick reflects only NEW
//!    >1h-old orphans (which themselves get swept within 10 minutes).
//!
//! Bounded scope:
//! - Limited to 200 orphans per sweep so the dashboard's stuck count
//!   trends down across multiple ticks rather than disappearing in one
//!   burst (operator-visible behaviour: "stuck went from 37 to 0
//!   instantly" looks like a bug; "stuck went 37 → 17 → 0" reads as a
//!   cleanup pass running).
//! - Skips allowlisted incidents (those already have their own group).
//! - Skips incidents that already have a decision (idempotent).

/// Orphan-recovery's truthful-containment guard (#987) only runs at the FIRST
/// decision. A High/Critical case decided `needs_review` while its IP was NOT
/// yet blocked stays in "needs your attention" forever once the block lands
/// later — the dashboard cries for action on an already-contained threat. Worse,
/// the agent's in-memory `response_lifecycle` record can DIVERGE from the live
/// firewall (an orphaned ufw rule the lifecycle forgot across a restart), so the
/// record-based `is_ip_actively_blocked` reports "not blocked" while ufw is
/// dropping the IP — exactly the case the operator hit.
///
/// ## Why it verifies the LIVE firewall (not the record)
/// Per [[project_block_enforcement_verify_live]] / spec-076: never trust an
/// internal is-blocked record as proof — verify live. This probes ufw+iptables
/// directly, so a divergent / orphaned block is still recognised as containment.
///
/// ## Why it is hole-free (operator's "se passar o block e ele retornar" worry)
/// - The Contained mark is **per-episode history**, not a standing promise. It is
///   only written for a case whose IP the firewall is dropping **right now**.
/// - If the block later lapses, a returning attacker raises a **new incident** →
///   a fresh case that this sweep will NOT auto-contain (the probe shows the IP
///   is no longer blocked), and the re-block path live-verifies the firewall
///   (spec-076) so an expired block is re-applied — never a free pass.
/// - **Active-harm detectors stay surfaced** even while blocked: the
///   `is_block_mitigated_detector` gate means only recon-class threats (a
///   firewall block fully mitigates) are auto-contained; reverse_shell, c2,
///   data_exfil, ransomware, kill_chain ALWAYS remain in needs_review.
/// - A failed probe contains nothing (`firewall_blocks` is fail-closed).
