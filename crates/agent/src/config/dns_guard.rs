//! DNS Guard export config section.
//!
//! The free agent knows which domains are malicious (IOC feeds, dns_c2 /
//! dns_tunneling intel). The paid `innerwarden-dns-guard` resolver enforces
//! against a denylist file it hot-reloads. This section is the **free → paid
//! intel bridge**: when enabled, the agent periodically exports its known-bad
//! domains to `denylist_path`, and the running DNS Guard picks them up live.
//! Free detection feeds paid prevention — the same line as the Execution Gate.
